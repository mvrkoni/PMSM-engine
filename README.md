                                                            ENERGY ELECTRONICS SYSTEM


1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
   This project involves the design of an energy electronics system in Matlab Simulink, including a three-phase network, rectifier, DC/DC converter, inverter, and a     synchronous motor with permanent magnets.

2. KEY FEATURES
  - Voltage regulation: 290V DC on inverter bus.
  - Speed control: Maintain 1200 RPM motor speed under a 15 Nm load.
  - Protection: Safeguards against excessive current, errors in the DC/DC converter, and motor over-speed.
